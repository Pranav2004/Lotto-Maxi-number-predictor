# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Lotto Max historical analysis tool that examines past winning numbers to identify patterns, frequency distributions, and statistical trends. The tool will analyze historical Lotto Max draw data to provide insights into number frequency, combinations, and patterns that users can use to inform their number selection strategy.

2. WHEN examining patterns THEN the system SHALL detect odd/even distribution trends
3. WHEN analyzing ranges THEN the system SHALL show frequency of numbers in different ranges (1-10, 11-20, etc.)
4. WHEN displaying patterns THEN the system SHALL show statistical significance of identified trends

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data-driven player, I want to generate number recommendations based on historical analysis, so that I can make informed choices for my ticket purchases.
